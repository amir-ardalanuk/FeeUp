## Mock Module
The Mock Module assumes the responsibility of providing mocks for test targets. Leveraging the power of SwiftyMocky for generating mocks from protocols, this module consolidates all the mock implementations within one unit, making them accessible for the required targets.

### Role
Inclusion in Test Targets: This module is intended to be incorporated into the test targets of the project, ensuring that mocks are readily available for testing scenarios.

Centralized Mock Storage: If any mock implementations are likely to be utilized by other modules, this module serves as an ideal location to house these mocks. It promotes reusability and maintainability of test-related code.
