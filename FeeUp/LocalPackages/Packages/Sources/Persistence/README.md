## Persistence Module
This module is responsible for saving and retrieving data from local storage. Currently, I utilize UserDefaults for caching data. However, if more complex data operations are required, it's advisable not to rely solely on this approach. Instead, opting for robust persistence data libraries like CoreData, Realm, or GRDP is recommended.

### Role
This module exclusively interacts with the Domain module. It possesses its own protocol for both data saving and retrieval.
