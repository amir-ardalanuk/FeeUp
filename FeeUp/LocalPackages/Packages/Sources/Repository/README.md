## Repository Module
The Repository Module assumes the critical role of providing accurate data to the upper-level module (App module) and managing the intricacies of data preparation. Whenever the task involves delivering, saving, and subsequently passing data to the next module, this is the designated area for implementing such logic.

Moreover, this module interfaces with the lower modules (Domain, API, Persistence) and determines the appropriate approach for serving data in a presentable manner.

### Role
The primary roles and responsibilities of the Repository Module encompass:

Providing Data to Upper-Level Modules: The repository acts as a data source for the higher-level application modules. It ensures that the correct and processed data is delivered as needed.

Managing Data Complexity: The repository abstracts the complexity of data management, allowing the upper layers to access the data they require without dealing with intricate details.

Implementing Logic for Data Flow: When data needs to be transferred between modules or components, the repository manages this flow and applies any necessary logic for data transformation and preparation.

Coordinating with Lower Modules: The repository interacts with the Domain, API, and Persistence modules to determine how to retrieve, aggregate, and present data effectively.

In an iOS architecture, the repository plays a pivotal role in facilitating the flow of data between different layers of the application. It aids in decoupling the presentation logic from data storage and retrieval mechanisms, thereby promoting maintainability, testability, and scalability. By centralizing data management and handling, the repository contributes to a well-structured and organized codebase.
